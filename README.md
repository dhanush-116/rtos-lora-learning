# LoRa Telemetry Node (RTOS Learning Project)

🚧 Status: In Progress — currently learning FreeRTOS task management, queues, and low-power scheduling.

This project will evolve over the next few weeks into a real-time LoRa sensor node with:
- FreeRTOS tasks
- Periodic scheduling
- Interrupt-driven sensing
- LoRa communication
- Low-power deep sleep cycles
