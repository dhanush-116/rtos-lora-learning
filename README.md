# LoRa Telemetry Node (RTOS Learning Project)

🚧 Status: In Progress — currently learning FreeRTOS task management, queues, and low-power scheduling.

This project will evolve over the next few weeks into a real-time LoRa sensor node with:
- FreeRTOS tasks
- Periodic scheduling
- Interrupt-driven sensing
- LoRa communication
- Low-power deep sleep cycles

## 📂 Project Structure
/firmware — ESP32 code  
/hardware — schematics, PCB design  
/docs — system design  

## 🧰 Tech Used
ESP32, FreeRTOS, LoRa, C, KiCad

## 📅 Learning Roadmap
- Week 1: FreeRTOS basics (tasks, queues)
- Week 2: LoRa driver integration
- Week 3: Low-power scheduling (deep sleep)
- Week 4: Telemetry protocol + Python dashboard

## 📊 Current Status
- Repository initialized
- FreeRTOS learning in progress
- Task scheduling implementation planned
